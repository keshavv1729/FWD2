                Physics is the scientific study of matter, its fundamental
                constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time,
                and the related entities of energy and force. It is one of the
                most fundamental scientific disciplines. A scientist who
                specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.

                Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines. Over much
                of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and
                certain branches of mathematics were a part of natural
                philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th
                century, these natural sciences branched into separate research
                endeavors. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas
                of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the
                boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined. New ideas in
                physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by
                other sciences and suggest new avenues of research in these
                and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and
                philosophy.

              <p>
                The word physics comes from the Latin <em>physica</em> ('study
                of nature'), which itself is a borrowing of the Greek
                <em>φυσική</em> (<em>phusikḗ</em> 'natural science'), a term
                derived from <em>φύσις</em> (<em>phúsis</em>
                'origin, nature, property').

                <a href="astronomy.html">astronomy</a> is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early
                civilizations dating before 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians,
                ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilization, had a
                predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the
                Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to
                represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations
                for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific
                and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the
                foundation for later <a href="astronomy.html">astronomy</a>, as the stars were found to
                traverse great circles across the sky, which could not
                explain the positions of the planets.

            <h3>Natural philosophy</h3>
            <article>
              Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic
              period (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers like
              Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural
              phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.
              They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many
              of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment; for
              example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years
              after it was proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.
