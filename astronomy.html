                Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects
                and the phenomena that occur in the
                <a href="index.html">cosmos</a>. It uses mathematics, <a href="Physics.html">physics</a>,
                and chemistry to explain their origin and their overall
                evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars,
                nebulae, galaxies, meteoroids, asteroids, and comets. Relevant
                phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts,
                quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background
                radiation. More generally, astronomy studies everything that
                originates beyond Earth's atmosphere.
                <a href="cosmology.html">cosmology</a> is the branch of
                astronomy that studies the universe as a whole.

                Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early
                civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations
                of the night sky. These include the Egyptians, Babylonians,
                Greeks, Indians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous
                peoples of the Americas. In the past, astronomy included
                disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation,
                observational astronomy, and the making of calendars.

                Astronomy (from the Greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον astron, "star"
                and -νομία -nomia from νόμος nomos, "law" or "rule") means study
                of celestial objects. Astronomy should not be confused with
                astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are
                correlated with the positions of celestial objects. The two
                fields share a common origin but became distinct, astronomy
                being supported by <a href="Physics.html">physics</a> while astrology is not.

                "Astronomy" and "astrophysics" are broadly synonymous in modern
                usage. In dictionary definitions, "astronomy" is "the
                study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and
                of their physical and chemical properties", while
                "astrophysics" is the branch of astronomy dealing with "the
                behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of
                celestial objects and phenomena". Sometimes, as in the
                introduction of the introductory textbook The Physical Universe
                by Frank Shu, "astronomy" means the qualitative study of the
                subject, whereas "astrophysics" is the <a href="Physics.html">physics</a>-oriented version
                of the subject. Some fields, such as astrometry, are in this
                sense purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics. Research
                departments may use "astronomy" and "astrophysics" according to
                whether the department is historically affiliated with a <a href="Physics.html">physics</a>
                department, and many professional astronomers have <a href="Physics.html">physics</a>
                rather than astronomy degrees. Thus, in modern use, the two
                terms are often used interchangeably.

                The initial development of astronomy was driven by practical
                needs like agricultural calendars. Before recorded history
                archeological sites such as Stonehenge provide evidence of
                ancient interest in astronomical observations.: Evidence
                also comes from artefacts such as the Nebra sky disc inlaid with
                symbols interpreted as a sun, moon, and stars including a
                cluster of seven stars. Megalithic structures
                located in Nabta Playa, Upper Egypt featured astronomical
                calendar arrangements in alignment with the heliacal rising of
                Sirius and supported calibration the yearly calendar for the
                annual Nile flood.

              Civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, India, China
              independently but with cross-cultural influences created
              astronomical observatories and developed ideas on the nature of
              the Universe, along with calendars and astronomical
              instruments. A key early development was the beginning of
              mathematical and scientific astronomy among the Babylonians,
              laying the foundations for astronomical traditions in other
              civilizations. The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses
              recurred in the saros cycle of 223 synodic months. Following
              the Babylonians, significant advances were made in ancient Greece
              and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy sought a rational,
              physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 4th
              century BC, Heracleides Ponticus was the first to proposed that
              the Earth rotates on its own axis.In the 3rd century BC,
              Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon
              and Sun, and he proposed a model of the Solar System where the
              Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the
              heliocentric model. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus
              calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the
              earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. He
              also observed the small drift in the positions of the equinoxes
              and solstices with respect to the fixed stars that we now know is
              caused by precession. Hipparchus also created a catalog of
              1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern
              hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera
              mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to
              calculate the location of the Sun, Moon, and planets for a given
              date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not
              reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical
              clocks appeared in Europe.
