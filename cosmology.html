                Cosmology is the study of the nature of the universe, the
                <a href="index.html">cosmos</a>. The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in
                Thomas Blount's Glossographia, with the meaning of "a speaking
                of the world". In 1731, German philosopher Christian Wolff
                used the term cosmology in Latin (cosmologia) to denote a branch
                of meta<a href="Physics.html">Physics</a> that deals with the general nature of the
                physical world.

                In the science of <a href="astronomy.html">astronomy</a>, physical cosmology is concerned
                with the study of the chronology of the universe, the observable
                universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and
                the ultimate fate of the universe, including the physical laws
                that govern these areas. Physical cosmology is a sub-branch
                of <a href="astronomy.html">astronomy</a> that is concerned with the universe as a whole.
                Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang Theory
                which attempts to bring together observational <a href="astronomy.html">astronomy</a> and
                particle physics; more specifically, a standard
                parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark
                energy, known as the <em>Lambda-CDM model</em>.

                the universe." Related: Cosmologist

              Physics and astrophysics have played central roles in shaping our
              understanding of the universe through scientific observation and
              experiment. Physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics
              and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe
              is generally understood to have begun with the Big Bang, followed
              almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation, an expansion of space
              from which the universe is thought to have emerged 13.799 ± 0.021
              billion years ago. Cosmogony studies the origin of the
              universe, and cosmography maps the features of the universe.

              In <em>Diderot's Encyclopédie</em>, cosmology is broken down into <em>uranology</em>
              (the science of the heavens), <em>aerology</em> (the science of the air),
              <em>geology</em> (the science of the continents), and <em>hydrology</em> (the
              science of waters). Metaphysical cosmology has also been
              described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship
              to all other entities. This is exemplified by Marcus Aurelius's
              observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does
              not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who
              does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who
              he is, nor what the world is."
