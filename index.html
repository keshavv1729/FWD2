                The <strong>cosmos</strong> is an alternative name for the
                universe or its nature or order. Usage of word cosmos implies
                viewing universe as a complex and orderly system or entity

                The cosmos is studied in <a href="./cosmology.html">cosmology</a> -
                a broad discipline covering scientific, religious or
                philosophical aspects of the cosmos and its nature. Religious
                and philosophical approaches may include the cosmos among
                spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside the
                physical universe.

                    The verb <em>kosmeîn</em> meant generally 'to dispose, prepare', but
                    especially 'to order and arrange' (troops for battle), 'to set
                    (an army) in array'; also 'to establish' (a government or
                    regime), 'to adorn, dress' (especially of women)
                </article>. Thus kósmos
                meant 'ornaments, decoration' (compare kosmokómes 'dressing the
                hair' and the English word cosmetic). The philosopher Pythagoras
                used the term kósmos for the order of the universe. Anaxagoras
                further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (nous) ordering
                all things.

              Eastern and Western thought differed greatly in their
              understanding of space and the organization of the cosmos. The
              Chinese saw the Cosmos as empty, infinite, and intertwined with
              the Earth. Western ideas, based on the ancient Greeks'
              understanding of the cosmos, believed in a multi-planar divided
              cosmos that was finite and filled with air.

                      Early Europeans viewed the cosmos as a divinely created,
                      spatially finite, bifurcated cosmos, divided into sublunary
                      and superlunary realms
                  </article>. Objects above the lunar disc were
                  believed to be stable, with heavenly bodies believed to be
                  made out of a refined substance called "quintessence". This
                  was understood to be a crystalline, completely transparent
                  substance that held all of the superlunary spheres in perfect
                  order. After their creation by God, these spheres did not
                  change except for their rotation above the Earth. Objects
                  below the lunar sphere were subject to constant combination,
                  separation, and recombination. This was because they consisted
                  of the chaotic elements of earth, air, fire, and water.

                      The idea of celestial spheres was developed in the
                      cosmological models of
                      <em>
                        Plato, Eudoxus, Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus,and others.
                      </em>
                      They believed in a stable cosmos created by God
                  </article>, where
                  distinct realms were subject to different kinds of order. Some
                  Europeans maintained the Aristotelian view that infinity could
                  only be seen as an attribute of God, with the cosmos being
                  finite. Furthermore, following the Aristotelian view that
                  "nature abhors a vacuum", some Europeans believed that the
                  space between the spheres were filled with air. This theory
                  persisted until the Scientific Revolution, when the discovery
                  that the Sun was in the center of the planetary system rocked
                  cosmological understanding to its core. Other theories such as
                  Atomism posited a void of atoms as the fundamental elements of
                  <a href="Physics.html">physics</a>, while Stoicism postulated a void allowing for the
                  cosmos to expand and contract in volume through its cycles.

                      The Hindus believed in a cyclic universe related to three
                      other beliefs: (i), time is endless and space has infinite
                      extension; (ii), earth is not the center of the universe; and
                      (iii), laws govern all development, including the creation and
                      destruction of the universe.
                  </article> The Indians believed that there
                  were three types of space, physiological, physical, and
                  infinite space. The infinite space consists of undivided
                  consciousness and everything that is inside and outside.
                  However, finite division of space is where time begins, and
                  the division of time is where all beings were first created.
                  It was believed that there are connections between the
                  physical and the psychological worlds, and an equivalence
                  existed between the outer cosmos and the inner cosmos of the
                  individual. This is expressed in the famous sentence -
                  <em>yat pinḍe tad brahmṇḍe</em>, “as in the body so in the
                  universe”. <br /><br />
                  The ancient Indians mapped out the outer world or the universe
                  at an altar where <em>Yajurveda</em> listed multiples of ten that
                  reached ten million. The numbers used to count to ten million
                  was used as a reference to show the relation of the planets in
                  the universe to Earth, it was not a relevant scale to the
                  entire universe, therefore backing that they believed the
                  universe to be infinite and endless. The Indians calculated
                  the speed of light to be four thousand four hundred and four
                  (4,404) yojanas per nimesa, or about one hundred eighty six
                  thousand (186,000) miles per second. Ancient Indian beliefs
                  also included the belief that the Earth was created after
                  certain stars, these stars include the Sun, Gemini, Aja, and
                  Kurma. Evidence from the Etymological considerations prove
                  this belief and also points towards the discovery of the twin
                  asses, which in western astrology can be found next to the
                  Cancer constellation as Asellus, Borealis, and Asellus
                  Australis.

                      The Indian cyclic model assumes the existence of countless
                      island universes, which go through their own periods of
                      development and destruction. The conception of cyclicity is
                      taken to be recursive.
                  </article> For an early exposition of these
                  astronomical and cosmological ideas, one may read al-Bīrūnī's
                  classic history of Indian science, composed in 1030 AD, and
                  for an even earlier, popular, view of Indian ideas, one may
                  consult the Vedantic text called the Yoga Vāsiṣṭha (YV), which
                  at 32,000 shlokas is one of the longest books in world
                  literature.
